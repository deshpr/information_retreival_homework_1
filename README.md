This repository contains code for Homework 1.

## To run the code

1. Navigate to the directory that has the code.
2. Open run_2.py
3. Change the argument to run() method to the path of the directory that lists all the txt files
4. From the command line, run:
` python run_2.py `

## What the Script does
The script generates a .csv file with the needed statistics. However, I had to put them together in a presentable
format so I could submit it in .pdf format. That pdf file has also been included in this repository with the name Assignment_One_Rahul_Deshpande.pdf

Also I have included the list of Stop words I used for this.
